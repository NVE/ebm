Assumptions
===========

The energy need in a buldings original condition is based on the energy requirement given by the building code. This energy requirement is one common value in in kWh per square. 
To get the energy need per energy purpose in the original condition, representative buildings per building category and building code
have been simulated in Simien. This work was originally done by Multiconsult in 2014 to simulate the energy purpose for buildings built built after different building codes to calculate a 
new building performance energy scale. There have been changes in the energy purpose since then, especially in lighting, due to new legislation from ecodesign. 
For more information on energy purpose in buildings see this summary report published in 2016 `Analyse av energibruk i yrkesbygg <https://publikasjoner.nve.no/rapport/2016/rapport2016_24.pdf>`_. 

In EBM 1.0 we assume that buildings undergo small measures and renovation over time. This reduces the energy need for the energy purpose space heating.
