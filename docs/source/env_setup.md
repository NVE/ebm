## Make a python virtual environment (optional)

While optional, it is always recommended to install and run python modules in a discrete virtual environment. To create a 
new python virtual environment (venv) type the following in a terminal.

 `python -m venv venv`


## Activate virtual environment
To use your venv you need to activate it
### Using powershell
(Your command prompt starts with PS) 
`\venv\Scripts\active.ps1`

### Using cmd
(Your command prompt starts with C:\ where C is any letter from A-Z)
`\venv\Scripts\active.bat`

### GNU/Linux and macOS

`source venv/bin/active`
