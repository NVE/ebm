  Model
    A representation of a real-world process or system.

  Building category
    As defined by the Norwegian energy performance requirements for buildings (TEK).

  TEK
    "Byggteknisk forskrift". The Norwegian standard for energy performance requirements for buildings.

  Energy requirement
    The amount of energy a building is projected to use per heated spuare meter floor area based on TEK. 

  Specific energy use
    How much energy a given building is expected to use based on its TEK class, condition and type and for which purpose.

  Energy purpose
    What the energy is used towards e.g. lighting, electrical appliances or heating.
  
  Behaviour factor
    Correction factor when there are large discrepancies between the energy requirements from TEK and what the building actually uses. 
  
  Energy improvement/improvement
    Yearly efficiency improvement on a energy purpose. 

  Renovation and small measure
    Improvements to the energy requirement related to space heating. 

  Small measure
    Small improvement to the energy requirement related to space heating.
  
  Renovation
    Moderate improvement to the energy requirement related to space heating.

  Original condition
    The original energy requirement without any renovation or small measures.
  
  Non substitutable electricity use
    Electricity use which can't be subsituted for another energy carrier i.e. lighting.

Heating systems
---------------
.. glossary::

  Heating systems
    The combination of various technologies providing space heating and hot tap water.
    The combination is on the format "base - peak - tertiary", for example "HP - Bio - Electricity". 

  Base load
    The heating technology which covers the majority of the heating demand.
  
  Peak load
    The heating technology which covers the remaining heating demand.
  
  Tertiary load
    The heating technology which covers the final heating demand. Only relevant for the heating system "HP - Bio - Electricity"

  <load> commodity
    The energy good used by the heating technology covering the specified load. 
  
  <load> utilisation factor
    How much of the heating demand is covered by the specified load per heating system group. 
  
  <load> efficiency
    How efficiently the heating technology can deliver the specified heating demand.
