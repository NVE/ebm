Heating systems
#################

Heating systems is the link from the computed *energy need* to *energy use*. *Energy need* states what the building requires in 
terms of space heating, non-substitutable electrical use and hot tap water. Heating systems assigns specific heating technologies to meet the energy
demand of space heating and hot tap water. Various heating technologies have different efficiencies and energy carriers which then gives an *energy use*.

The input to EBM is aggregated heating system shares for houses, apartment blocks and non-residental buildings. The source of the intial shares is the 
Norwegian energy performance building database which has been processed outside of EBM. As part of the processing the energy useage per product and building category is compared with the 
national energy balance to fine tune the distribution of the various heating technologies. The process is described under "methods" and "assumptions" and an overview 
is shown in the flowchart below. 

The method for forecasting is also described in the subpages.
