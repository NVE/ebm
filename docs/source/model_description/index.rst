Model Description
#############################

This is a bottom-up model that estimates how area, energy need, heating systems and energy use in the building stock changes over time. 
The annual energy use can be distributted geographically as defined by the user.

The Four Steps of the Model
---------------------------

Each building category is treated individually, and there are four steps in the calculations for each building category:

#. Determine rates for:
    a. Implementation of small energy efficiency measures (called small measures)
    b. Renovation
    c. Demolition
    d. New construction
#. Project area development, with area distributed by condition, i.e., whether the area is in origial condition or has undergone small measures or renovation or both.
#. Link area to relevant energy requirement distributed by energy purpose.
#. Assign heating system to the area to determine the use of different energy products (electricity, district heating, wood, natural gas).
