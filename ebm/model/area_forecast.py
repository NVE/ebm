# Comments:
# - condition_list: must contain all 5 conditions -> must update input data of condition_list or hardcode, and adjust methods for scurve in buildings
# - create an Area data_class? if so, the class can take area_params as input and get relevant data (for the building cat and tek) trough the class
# - could use tek_list as input argument and loop trough all TEKs in this class:
#       - then there can be one method for area_per_tek and one where all are grouped together, e.g. with TEK as keys in a dict for example
#       - this could be used to filter the area parameters, for example an area dataclass 

# Possible issue in the future:
# - problemer med riving og nybygging kobling dersom tidshorisonten overstiger tidligste alder for riving pÃ¥ nye TEKer
