    # - create instance variables dynamically from column names? or change to constans? -> change to constans for now
    # - change name of methods to be more accurate, e.g. the current s-curve method (snakk med Benedicte)
    # - change s_curve method to only return a list of shares? The year key in the dict is not necessary in further calculations. -> YES, change this.
