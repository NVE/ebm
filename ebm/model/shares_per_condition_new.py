        """
        Calculate the percentage share of area that is demolished over time for a specific TEK.

        This method calculates the demolition shares for a specific TEK for each year from the start year to 
        the end year. It uses an S-curve to define the demolition rates and adjusts them based on the building 
        age in each year.

        The demolition share is calculated by taking the difference between the S-curve rate in the current year 
        and the previous year, and then accumulating these differences over time. Specific conditions are applied 
        to modify the general calculation logic as outlined below:

        - The share is set to 0 in the model start year. The floor area of a TEK in the start year is considered
          to be the area at the end of the year. Therefore, no building measures should be taken in this year.  
        - The share is set to 0 in model years before and including the building year of the TEK. There should be
          no measures taken in the first year that the building is constructed. In other words, the first measure
          can only be taken when the building is one year old.
        - The share is set to the S-curve rate of the model year if that year corresponds to the year after the 
          building was constructed. This is only the case if the building is constructed after the start year of 
          the model period. In this case, the S-curve rate at age 1 should be used, and after that the general 
          calculation method is applied.   

        Arguments:
        - tek (str): The identifier for the specific TEK for which the shares are calculated.

        Returns:
        - pd.Series: A Pandas Series with the calculated demolition shares for the specific TEK, where the index

        Calculate the percentage share of floor area that has undergone either small measures or renovation over the

        This method calculates the percentage share of floor area that has undergone either small measures or renovation 
        for each year in the model period. The share represents the total accumulated area affected by either condition

        from being counted in the other, meaning that the floor area can undergo both small measures and renovation.

        The calculation is based on the rates from the respective S-curve (small measure or renovation), while ensuring
